## 📚 Introduction

Sign language is a crucial form of communication for individuals with hearing impairments. SignSense aims to bridge the communication gap by accurately interpreting hand signs and translating them into text or voice. The project utilizes machine learning techniques and computer vision to achieve high accuracy and real-time sign language recognition.

## 🌟 Features

- Real-time hand sign recognition using deep learning techniques
- High accuracy of over 95% for hand sign recognition
- User-friendly web interface for seamless interaction
- Translation of recognized signs into text or voice output
- Easy-to-use API endpoints for integration with other applications

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight and versatile web framework in Python that powers the backend of the SignSense application.
- **TensorFlow** and **Keras**: Deep learning frameworks used to train and deploy the hand sign recognition model.
- **MediaPipe**: A cross-platform framework used for hand tracking and pose estimation.
- **NumPy** and **OpenCV**: Essential libraries for handling numerical operations and computer vision tasks.
- **Flask Templating**: Used to create dynamic web pages and render results seamlessly.

## 📈 Model Training

The SignSense model is trained using a neural network architecture that incorporates the principles of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled hand sign images to recognize a wide range of sign gestures accurately. The training process includes data preprocessing, augmentation, and optimization to achieve optimal accuracy.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To set up and run the SignSense application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/SignSense.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python app.py`
4. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`
